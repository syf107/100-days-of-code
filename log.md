**Thoughts:** I really struggled with Machine Learning. The wide broad of topics and the amount things to learn is so overwhelming. I feel like this is the end for me. As I have accident in training a big model following a tutorial. My old laptop is just not let me. I took 5 hours just to fix and wait. The environment just won't let me. So I decided to go back to web development.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
