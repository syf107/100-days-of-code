# 100 Days Of Code - Log Round 1

### Day 01: June 01, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Starting from FreeCodeCamp. HTML & CSS again.

**Thoughts:** After I explored Python and a very little bit of Machine Learning, I don't know I want to go back to the Web Development. The struggle is a real deal with Machine Learning. Today I've spent with the training models for so long today and my old laptop just won't let me explore the way smoothly. So, I have to be wise. I'm going back to web development. Hopefully, it will go smooth.
