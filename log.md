**Thoughts:** I really struggled with Machine Learning. The wide broad of topics and the amount things to learn is so overwhelming. I feel like this is the end for me. As I have accident in training a big model following a tutorial. My old laptop is just not let me. I took 5 hours just to fix and wait. The environment just won't let me. So I decided to go back to web development.

It is good and easier because this is not my first attempt. <br>- Started Class 01 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/100Devs?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#100Devs</a> Software Engineering Bootcamp by <a href="https://twitter.com/leonnoel?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@leonnoel</a> . Will definitely watch the videos you&#39;ve suggested. Thank your for your work!</p>&mdash; Syarief Arifin (@anaketigabelas) <a href="https://twitter.com/anaketigabelas/status/1400092431043895302?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 2, 2021</a></blockquote>

**Thoughts:** I think I know why I am failed in learning Machine Learning and my prior bootcamp. There're aspects more than my devices. It is something that Leon discussed in #100Devs Class. It is about how I am bad in managing time, frustration, and taking care of myself. Moreover, I have no good learning method. I will definitely approach this better in doing Web Development right now. I am glad deciding join this program.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Day 3 of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysOfCode?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#100DaysOfCode</a> <br>- I did all the Basic CSS in Responsive Web Design freeCodeCamp, starting the Applied Visual Design.<br>- I have been there, doing the course in CSS, good. Then, trying it do the projects, it is right but it is all wrong.<br><br>Will approach it better this time.</p>&mdash; Syarief Arifin (@anaketigabelas) <a href="https://twitter.com/anaketigabelas/status/1400488229342646276?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2021</a></blockquote>

**Thoughts:** This type of learning indeed gives the excitement because you can see a slight success when doing each chapter. But coding is a skill that will grow when you do the projects and it includes the CSS. It's kinda hard to approach CSS than HTML. You often don't know how to put something appear into something. By the way, the material is good. The penguin! I am always fascinated by how people actually draws something with CSS. It's skill that I want to get, dunno why.

**Thoughts:** I don't really code today. I take this as a good break and instead doing the homework that's still part of #100Devs Free Software Engineering Bootcamp. So I don't really break. This information is new for me. I've got my mind blown by it. Though it is hard to digest, as the facts that rereading, highlighting, and summarizing and making notes have been with me all the time. I will definitely trying this Active Recall and Space Repetition. To dive deeper, I started also Learning How to Learn by Barbara Oakley.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Day 5 of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysOfCode?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#100DaysOfCode</a><br>- Got the 1/2 of homework Class-01, Ali Abdaal&#39;s videos and Week 1 Learning How to Learn.<br>- Decided to do the Class-02 of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/100Devs?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#100Devs</a>. Got the first hour. It was the review of class 1 and then to HTML. I love how <a href="https://twitter.com/leonnoel?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@leonnoel</a> explains the importance of semantic.</p>&mdash; Syarief Arifin (@anaketigabelas) <a href="https://twitter.com/anaketigabelas/status/1401207693302403076?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2021</a></blockquote> 

**Thoughts:** Doing the Learning How to Learn course by Barbara Oakley from Coursera. It is an amazing experience to know how our brain works. I agree with how Leon Noel said that it is criminal to not teach this way and method in our school. I mean, I have done twelve years until the high school, three years in doing Diploma III, and this method is out of radar. Then, I did the first hour of the Class-02 of Free Software Engineering Bootcamp. Leon's explanation is great. I love he really emphasizes the importance of semantic meaning in writing HTML. It is something new for me. Something I didn't get when I approached Web Development's course last time.
