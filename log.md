**Thoughts:** I really struggled with Machine Learning. The wide broad of topics and the amount things to learn is so overwhelming. I feel like this is the end for me. As I have accident in training a big model following a tutorial. My old laptop is just not let me. I took 5 hours just to fix and wait. The environment just won't let me. So I decided to go back to web development.

**Thoughts:** I think I know why I am failed in learning Machine Learning and my prior bootcamp. There're aspects more than my devices. It is something that Leon discussed in #100Devs Class. It is about how I am bad in managing time, frustration, and taking care of myself. Moreover, I have no good learning method. I will definitely approach this better in doing Web Development right now. I am glad deciding join this program.
